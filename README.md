# Python-MySQL-Speedtest-logger
Python script that uses MySQL and Python speedtest-cli to run a speedtest and log the results to a database.

After logging the test to the MySQL database, it then gets the average speed across all logged tests.

NOTE: If downloading for usage, go to the python file and set the password field and username field of the mydb variable to the mysql password on your device.
If not set then it will not be able to connect to your MySQL database.
